IMPORTANT: Before Building the C++ Agent
===============================================================================

You MUST download the nlohmann JSON library header file before building.

Steps:
------

1. Open your web browser

2. Go to: https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/latest

3. Look for "json.hpp" in the Assets section

4. Click on "json.hpp" to download it

5. Move the downloaded file to this location:
   FactoryAgent/include/json.hpp

6. Now you can open and build the Visual Studio project

Alternative Direct Link:
-----------------------
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp

You can also:
- Right-click the link above
- Choose "Save As"
- Save to: FactoryAgent/include/json.hpp

Why is this needed?
------------------
The C++ agent uses the nlohmann/json library for JSON parsing.
This is a single-header library (no compilation needed).
We don't include it in the project files due to licensing distribution.
